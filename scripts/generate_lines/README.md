Minecraft functions are limited in certain capacities, including lacking for-loops and the ability to input a variable into a command.  Thus, this script was necessary to edit mass-lines of code that had different numerical values based on a function, typically modelling a motion.

For example, one of the functions generated by this controls the motion of the horses/ducks in Jevil's carousel attack, resembling a sine wave.
