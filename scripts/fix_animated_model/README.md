# fix_animated_model
Creates a 3D animated model based on multiple 3D JSON model inputs.  I originally tried to use [vberlier's tool](https://vberlier.github.io/animated-models/), but it outputted a broken model when I used it at the time.  
Knowing how Minecraft models work, I made this tool so I could incorporate my own 3D animated models into the map.
