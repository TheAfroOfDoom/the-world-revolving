# generate_markdown
After completing The World Revolving, I wrote this script to assist with writing markdown of consistent formatting to describe the project.  Since Minecraft coding consists of 1 file per function (unlike typical languages where you can include multiple definitions in a single file), the organization of your files in a Minecraft datapack is heavily important for both readability and often the actual functionality of the project.

I like to provide a description of most of my functions for my Minecraft projects so that anyone can come here and learn how they work.
