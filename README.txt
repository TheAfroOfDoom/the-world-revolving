This is the Resource Pack required for things like custom textures, sounds,
models, etc.  If you are playing SINGLEPLAYER, you shouldn't need to do anything
with the Resource Pack, as the world file already auto-equips the pack.  If
you are playing MULTIPLAYER, however, you can do one of three things to ensure
everyone gets the Resource Pack.

1. Send the download link for the Map to everyone and have them equip the pack.
2. Send the pack directly to them.
3. Setup a download link for the pack (ex. Dropbox) and put that in your
server.properties so that it auto-downloads for anyone who joins your server.
